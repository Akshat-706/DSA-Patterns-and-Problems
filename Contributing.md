## 📌 Steps to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

* Click on the **Fork** button (top right of this repo).
* This creates a copy of the repo under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DSA-14Day-Internship.git
cd DSA-14Day-Internship
```

### 3. Create Your Folder

Use the format: `PlatformName_YourName`
Example: `LeetCode_Arya` or `GFG_Mrunalini`.

### 4. Add Daily Subfolders

Inside your folder, create subfolders for each day:

```text
LeetCode_YourName/
├── Day-1/
│   ├── Problem.md
│   ├── Solution.java
│   ├── Flowchart.png
├── Day-2/
│   ├── Problem.md
│   ├── Solution.java
│   ├── Flowchart.png
...
├── Day-14/
│   ├── Problem.md
│   ├── Solution.java
│   ├── Flowchart.png
```

### 📂 File Guidelines

* `Problem.md` → Include problem statement, your thought process, and time/space complexity.
* `Solution.ext` → Your code file (.cpp, .java, .py, etc.).
* `Flowchart.png` → A diagram/image of your chosen approach.

⚠️ **Make sure filenames are consistent** — case-sensitive on GitHub.

### 🔄 Workflow for Daily Contribution

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added Day-1 solution for LeetCode_YourName"
git push origin main
```

* Go to the original repo → Click **New Pull Request**.

### ✅ Pull Request Rules

* Each PR should only contain your folder updates (don’t touch other participants’ folders).
* One PR per day is recommended.
* PRs missing any required files (`Problem.md`, `Solution.ext`, or `Flowchart.png`) may be rejected.

### 🚨 Late Joining Rule

* If you joined after the start date, you can still catch up.
* Solve multiple problems in a single day until you are up-to-date.
* All contributions must be complete by **24th September 2025**.

### 🎯 Tips

* Keep your solutions simple and well-documented.
* Ask doubts or share discussions in **Issues/Discussions** tab.
* Be respectful to other contributors.

🙌 **Happy Coding & All the Best for your 14-Day DSA Journey!**
