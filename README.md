# 📘 DSA 14-Day Internship Challenge

Welcome to the **DSA 14-Day Internship Challenge** 🎉  
This is a structured open-source program designed to help you build consistency in solving Data Structures & Algorithms problems while documenting your journey like a professional.  

🚀 **Organized as part of a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA) community event** to empower students in coding, problem-solving, and open-source contribution.  

📅 **Challenge Duration:** 11th September 2025 → 24th September 2025 (14 Days)

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Fork this repository.**  
2. **Create a folder** with the name format:  
   **`PlatformName_YourName`**  
   Example: `LeetCode_Arya` or `GFG_Mrunalini`.  
3. **Inside your folder, create subfolders for each day:**  

LeetCode_YourName/
├── Day-1/
│ ├── Problem.md
│ ├── Solution.java
│ ├── Flowchart.png
├── Day-2/
│ ├── Problem.md
│ ├── Solution.java
│ ├── Flowchart.png
...
├── Day-14/
│ ├── Problem.md
│ ├── Solution.java
│ ├── Flowchart.png


4. Each **Day-X** must include:  
- `Problem.md` → Problem statement + your approach + time/space complexity.  
- `Solution.ext` → Code in your preferred language (`.cpp`, `.py`, `.java`, etc.).  
- `Flowchart.png` → Diagram of your solution approach.  

5. Commit daily → Create a Pull Request.
